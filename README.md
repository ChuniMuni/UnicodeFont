Addon to view chinese, russian, english, japanese, korean and a bunch of other languages. For information on what languages are supported, view the FontLicense file.

Based on UnicodeFont 1.4.1, updated to support latest WenQuanYi Zen Hei (0.9.45) font and addon changed to affect chat only.

Keep in mind this addon addon will only make you able to read the supported languages.
If you are interesting in writting in chinese, russian etc, download Locale Emulator and run Wow.exe with it.
